# PDF splitter app for printing

PDF Splitter is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to split PDF files into odd and even pages. It also includes an option to reverse the order of even pages, which is useful for certain printing workflows. This feature ensures that when printing odd pages first and then even pages, the resulting printed document maintains the correct sequential order.
